# Project Status Report

Below is the current status of **StartupFromScratch**, evaluated against the "Definitions of Success" from `startingPrompt.md`:

## 1. Monorepo & Tooling
- Yarn v4 workspaces configured in root `package.json` (`workspaces: ["packages/*"]`).
- TypeScript v5.4.5 set globally and in each package `tsconfig.json`.
- Top‑level lifecycle scripts (`setup`, `develop`, `build`, `deploy`, `lint`, `test`) are present and defined.

## 2. Infrastructure & Local Databases
- `docker-compose.yml` defines services:
  - `postgres` (ankane/pgvector:v0.4.0+)
  - `redis` (7.4.0-alpine)
  - `server`, `jobs`, `ui` with proper builds and dependencies.
- `scripts/develop.sh` toggles Docker vs native mode and links correct Prisma schema.
- Prisma schemas exist for both PostgreSQL (`schema.postgres.prisma`) and SQLite (`schema.sqlite.prisma`).
- `scripts/setup.sh` initializes dependencies and generates Prisma client.

## 3. ESLint, TypeScript & Testing
- Global ESLint config (`.eslintrc.js`) with `@typescript-eslint` plugin applied.
- Testing dependencies (`mocha`, `chai@^5.0.0`, `sinon`) are installed in root `devDependencies`.
- Each package has `build-tests` and `test` scripts; shared test setup file referenced in `dist/__test/setup.js`.
- Present tests:
  - Placeholder test in `packages/server/src/index.test.ts`.
- Missing tests in UI components, shared utilities, and other packages.

## 4. Windows/Mac "One‑Click" Start
- `pkg` is included as a dependency.
- `scripts/build.sh` contains a placeholder for packaging CLI executables (`pkg tools/cli.ts ...`).
- No actual CLI entrypoint script implemented yet.

## 5. Lifecycle Scripts & CI/CD
- Lifecycle scripts (`setup.sh`, `develop.sh`, `build.sh`, `deploy.sh`) implement the bulk of expected behavior.
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/dev.yml`, `master.yml`) exist for staging and production flows.

## 6. Documentation
- Core docs in `/docs` (architecture, setup, dev, build, ci-cd, testing, deployment) cover intended workflows.
- README.md and `.env-example` are provided.
- Documentation aligns closely with current implementation.

## 7. UI & Server Functionality
- **UI**: React 18 + MUI; routing and basic pages implemented in `App.tsx`.
  - SSR entries (`entry-server.tsx`, `entry-client.tsx`) scaffolded via Vite.
- **Server**: Express serves static UI and two SSR routes (`/`, `/about`) with stubbed SSO meta tags.
  - Database-driven SSO logic currently stubbed in `getSsoConfig()`.
  - No API or webhook endpoints mounted yet (TODO noted in code).

## 8. Gap Analysis & Next Steps
1. Write real tests for UI components, shared utilities, and other packages.
2. Implement API and webhook routers in `packages/server/src`.
3. Replace stubbed `getSsoConfig()` with actual Prisma-driven DB queries.
4. Create CLI entrypoints and finalize `pkg` bundling.
5. Add Storybook and component stories/tests in UI.
6. Implement core logic in `jobs`, `redis-db`, and `shared` packages.
7. Extend documentation for any newly added modules or workflows.

## 9. Docker Development Startup: Configured
- `scripts/develop.sh` with `USE_DOCKER=true` invokes `docker-compose up --build`, bringing up Postgres, Redis, server, jobs, and UI.
- Dockerfiles exist for `server` and `jobs`, and `docker-compose.yml` mounts code volumes and exposes ports:
  - Server on `4000`
  - UI on `3000`
- This setup enables a one‑command Docker‑backed dev environment.

## 10. Full Build Verification: Configured
- `scripts/build.sh`:
  1. Cleans previous `dist/` folders.
  2. Runs `yarn workspaces foreach run build` for all packages.
  3. Executes an SSR build for UI (`vite build --ssr`).
  4. Zips built artifacts to `/var/tmp/<version>/`.
- Supports both development and production modes via the `-p/--production` flag.

## 11. Native Startup: Configured
- `scripts/develop.sh` with `USE_DOCKER=false`:
  1. Links `schema.sqlite.prisma` (or `schema.postgres.prisma` if `DB_TYPE` set differently) for Prisma.
  2. Spawns TypeScript watchers via `ts-node-dev` for:
     - Server (SSR Express on port 4000)
     - Jobs
     - UI (Vite dev server on port 3000)
- This flow supports Windows/Mac/Linux development without Docker, using SQLite locally.
