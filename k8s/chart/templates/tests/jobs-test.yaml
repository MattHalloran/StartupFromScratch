# This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod that serves as a Helm test.
# Its purpose is to verify that the 'jobs' service is reachable from within the Kubernetes cluster.
# It attempts to connect to the service's health check endpoint (or a default '/healthcheck' path).
# This test is crucial for ensuring that the jobs service, which might handle background tasks or asynchronous operations,
# is up and responsive after deployment.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  # The name of the test Pod. It includes the full release name and service identifier for uniqueness.

    # Standard labels for identifying the application and release.

  annotations:
    # This annotation designates the Pod as a Helm test hook.
    # Helm will execute this Pod when 'helm test <release-name>' is run.
    "helm.sh/hook": test
    # Defines the deletion policy for the test Pod.
    # 'before-hook-creation': Any existing Pod from a previous test run with the same name will be deleted before this one is created.
    # 'hook-succeeded': The Pod will be deleted automatically if the test passes.
    # If the test fails, the Pod will be kept for inspection.

  containers:
    # This section defines the container(s) that will run inside the Pod.
    - name: wget
      # Uses a minimal 'busybox' image, which contains common Unix utilities like 'wget'.
      image: busybox
      # The command to be executed in the container is 'wget'.
      command: ['wget']
      # Arguments passed to the 'wget' command.
      # The goal is to attempt an HTTP GET request to the jobs service's health endpoint.
      # Similar to other service tests, if the jobs service uses a different health check mechanism or path,
      # this command might need adjustment.
      args: [
        '-qO-',  # '-q' (quiet): Suppresses wget's normal output.
                  # '-O-' (output document to stdout): Sends the downloaded content to standard output.
                  # No explicit timeout ('-T') is set here, so wget will use its default timeout.
                  # Consider adding a timeout for consistency with other tests if needed.
        # The URL to which wget will attempt to connect. This is constructed dynamically:
        # 1. Service name: '{{ include "vrooli.fullname" . }}-jobs' (e.g., 'myrelease-vrooli-jobs')
        # 2. Service port: '{{ (index .Values.services "jobs").port }}' (e.g., '8081')
        # 3. Health check path: '{{ (index .Values.services "jobs").probes.readinessPath | default "/healthcheck" }}'
        #    This uses the 'readinessPath' defined in the values for the jobs service.
        #    If 'readinessPath' is not defined, it defaults to '/healthcheck'.
        # The resulting URL will look like: 'http://myrelease-vrooli-jobs:8081/healthcheck'
        '{{ include "vrooli.fullname" . }}-jobs:{{ (index .Values.services "jobs").port }}{{ (index .Values.services "jobs").probes.readinessPath | default "/healthcheck" }}'
      ]
  # Defines the restart policy for all containers in the Pod.
  # 'Never': If the container fails (e.g., wget cannot connect and exits with an error) or completes successfully,
  # Kubernetes will not attempt to restart it. This is standard for test Pods.
  restartPolicy: Never
