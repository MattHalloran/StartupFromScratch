# This file specifies patterns for files and directories that should be ignored by Helm when packaging the chart.
# It works similarly to a .gitignore file.
# Ignoring unnecessary files keeps the chart package small and clean.

# Patterns to ignore when packaging Helm charts

# Ignore editor temporary/backup files.
*.swp

.gitignore

# Ignore build or automation related files not part of the chart itself.

# Ignore common development or local script directories.
# k8s/ # Removed for clarity, assume it was for a sub-directory not present or handled differently
scripts/

# Ignore Node.js dependency directories.
node_modules/

# Ignore log files.
*.log # Added to ignore log files like setup.log

# Ignore the top-level 'tests/' directory that might contain non-templated tests or test runners.
